### Introduction

- This is a course in modern macroeconomics of the type practiced in current academic research.
- This means a unified approach to macroeconomics which is based on microfoundations and general equilibrium taking into account possible market imperfections.
- We will study economic choices that are key for macroeconomic developments, such as the consumption-savings decision, the labour-leisure decision, and the investment decision.
- These are the building blocks for some models with which we can study the behaviour of aggregate variables as well as the role of economic policies.
